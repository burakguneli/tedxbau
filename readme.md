### WTF is it?

this is source of TEDxBahcesehir's web site. Mostly single page (landing page) website but there will be small additions such as team page (which is not available yet).

You can do whatever you want, release, redistribute etc etc BUT *provide exact link of this source code and website inside yours source code (index page) on top of it... (see my index for example... before <html> tag.)*

### Other contributors:

first, [@burakguneli] started on this project on top of bootstrap but i wasn't happy with it because of a lot of add-ons, plugins etc it was sloppy and slow.
so i decided to complete-rewrite from scratch. And this is it.

i don't know where they found theme-n-stuff but i replicated similarly... (actually afaik some designer draw on photoshop sometime)

Also i'm using these libraries in my project

- [hint.css](//github.com/chinchang/hint.css) v2
- [jquery](//jquery.com/) v2.2.0
- [jquery.easing.js](//gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/) v1.3
- [Open Sans](//www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) v2.0
- [owl.carousel](//smashingboxes.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) v2.0.0-b3
